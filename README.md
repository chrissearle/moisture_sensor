# Moisture sensor

Measure soil moisture with LOLIN D32.

Note - currently just a test.

Uses the following libraries from https://github.com/zhouhan0126

- WifiManager
- DNSServer
- WebServer

These are placed in the platformio project library directory here directly - since I couldn't find them in the registry.
